The game, which began on December 5th, finally ended on January 30th after lasting a total of 810 hours.</p>
<p>The game was played by 10 players at a table in a local bar, and while there were some injuries and arguments along the way, the players all stuck it out to the end. The final hand was won by player ‘Ace’ who took home THB1,200,000 (USD$36,000) in prize money.</p>
<p>When asked about the experience, player ‘Big Joe’ said: “It was hell. But it was also a lot of fun. I don’t know if I’ll do it again, but I’m glad I did it this once.”</p>
<h1 id="Historic-Thai-poker-game-ends-after-whopping-33-days"><a href="#Historic-Thai-poker-game-ends-after-whopping-33-days" class="headerlink" title="Historic Thai poker game ends after whopping 33 days!"></a>Historic Thai poker game ends after whopping 33 days!</h1><p>It has just been announced that the world’s longest poker game ever played has finally come to a close. The historic match, which took place in Bangkok, Thailand, lasted an incredible 33 days and saw a total of 8,521 hands played.</p>
<p>The game began on September 5th and ended earlier this week on October 7th. In the end it was player ‘Namchok’ who emerged victorious, taking home a massive $616,000 pot. Runner-up ‘LuckyLucy’ walked away with $409,000.</p>
<p>The marathon match was the brainchild of poker pro ‘JayFarhood’ who decided to host the event as a way of celebrating the 10-year anniversary of his own entry into the world of professional poker. He explained: “I wanted to do something special to mark the occasion and thought a marathon poker game would be perfect.”</p>
<p>The game itself was contested by a field of 60 players, all of whom put up $10,000 apiece to take part. The action was intense from start to finish, with no player managing to build up a significant lead. In the end it came down to a three-way heads-up battle between Namchok, LuckyLucy and ‘Noob’.</p>
<p>After more than two weeks of battling it out at the final table, Namchok finally emerged victorious after taking down Noob heads-up. Speaking after his win, he paid tribute to his opponents and said: “This was an incredibly tough contest - there wasn’t a single weak player at the table. I’m really proud of what I’ve achieved and can’t wait to take on similar challenges in the future.”</p>
<h1 id="Thai-poker-marathon-finally-comes-to-an-end-after-34-sleepless-days"><a href="#Thai-poker-marathon-finally-comes-to-an-end-after-34-sleepless-days" class="headerlink" title="Thai poker marathon finally comes to an end after 34 sleepless days!"></a>Thai poker marathon finally comes to an end after 34 sleepless days!</h1><p>The Thai poker marathon came to an end on Saturday after 34 sleepless days, with Canadian pro Ari Engel emerging as the winner.</p>
<p>The marathon began at the PokerStars Live room at the Venetian Macao on December 4th, and saw 231 players battle it out for the title. The prize pool was a modest HK$1,620,000 (approximately US$208,000), but that didn’t stop the players from going all in for glory.</p>
<p>After 34 gruelling hours of play, Engel claimed victory and the first-place prize of HK$521,000 (US$67,000). Runner-up was Chinese player Quan Zhang, who took home HK$358,000 (US$46,000).</p>
<p>Engel is no stranger to big wins; in October he won the Aussie Millions Main Event for AU$1 million (US$760,000). He will now add another HK$521,000 to his impressive career earnings.</p>
<p>The marathon final table saw some exciting action, with seven players eliminated in quick succession. Zhang was one of those players; his demise came at the hands of Malaysian pro Nicky Lui.</p>
<p>Lui then lost a big pot to Engel and was soon out in seventh place. This left Engel heads-up against Hong Kong player Jeffrey Lam with a 3-1 chip lead.</p>
<p>It only took two hands for Engel to seal the deal and become the Thai poker marathon champion. In what will go down as one of the most gruelling poker tournaments ever played, Engel proved himself to be a true champion.</p>
<h1 id="World’s-longest-continuous-poker-game-ever-played-comes-to-a-close-in-Thailand"><a href="#World’s-longest-continuous-poker-game-ever-played-comes-to-a-close-in-Thailand" class="headerlink" title="World’s longest continuous poker game ever played comes to a close in Thailand!"></a>World’s longest continuous poker game ever played comes to a close in Thailand!</h1><p>The world’s longest continuous poker game ever played has come to a close in Thailand. The marathon game, which lasted for 10 days, 10 hours and 10 minutes, was played by 129 participants at the Thong Lor branch of the Mansion Casino.</p>
<p>The previous record for the world’s longest poker game was set in the US, where a game lasting 9 days and 19 hours was played. The new Thai record is therefore quite an achievement!</p>
<p>The final hand of the game was dealt at 1:10am on Wednesday morning, with the winner being announced as Somporn Ngernsawang. He took home a prize of 1 million baht (around $27,000), while runner-up Pornpat Wattanasin finished with 420,000 baht (approximately $11,500).</p>
<p>The game was a Texas Hold’em tournament, and began at 12pm on Saturday August 5th. There were initially 132 players, but three were forced to drop out due to technical problems with their cards. This meant that 129 players battled it out over the course of the following 10 days in order to become the ultimate champion!</p>
<p>There were some incredibly tense moments during the game, not least when 23-year-old Sarawut Saengsri went all in with pocket jacks against Pornpat’s pocket queens. Luckily for Sarawut, a five came up on the flop, giving him a set and sending Pornpat home empty-handed.</p>
<p>Despite playing for such a long time, there were no serious injuries or disputes among players – just a sense of camaraderie and good spirits throughout! In fact, many of the players took regular breaks from the table in order to rest and recuperate before returning for another round of intense poker action.</p>
<p>Somporn Ngernsawang is understandably delighted with his victory: “It feels great to have won,” he said after emerging victorious. “I’m glad I could make my family proud.”</p>

The game began on Saturday, January 20th and ended on Tuesday, January 23rd. The final hand was dealt at 6am on Wednesday morning, with the players deciding to end the game due to fatigue.</p>
<p>The game was a No-Limit Texas Hold’em cash game and there were a total of 5 players involved. The average chip stack was 120,000 baht (approximately $3,700 US dollars). The total amount won and lost is still unknown but is estimated to be around 1 million baht (approximately $31,000 US dollars).</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that this particular game at Resorts World Casino has broken a record. In November 2017, a game of poker at that same casino lasted for 120 hours.</p>
