        <h1 id="Broncos-Surge-to-Victory-in-Week-1-Thanks-to-Strong-Betting-Performance"><a href="#Broncos-Surge-to-Victory-in-Week-1-Thanks-to-Strong-Betting-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Broncos Surge to Victory in Week 1 Thanks to Strong Betting Performance"></a>Broncos Surge to Victory in Week 1 Thanks to Strong Betting Performance</h1><p>The Denver Broncos kicked off their season with a strong performance against the Seattle Seahawks, coming away with a 27-24 victory. This was a much-needed win for the Broncos, who are looking to rebound from a disappointing 5-11 season last year.</p>
<p>The Broncos were able to win thanks largely to their strong betting performance. QB Case Keenum had an impressive debut for the team, throwing for 329 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also avoided any turnovers, something that has been a problem for him in the past.</p>
<p>The defense was also solid, holding the Seahawks to just 244 total yards. Rookie Bradley Chubb had a particularly good game, recording 3 sacks and forcing 2 fumbles.</p>
<p>With this win, the Broncos have established themselves as one of the top contenders in the AFC West. They will need to continue playing well if they want to make it back to the playoffs.</p>
<h1 id="Broncos-Favorites-Heading-into-Monday-Night-Football-Showdown"><a href="#Broncos-Favorites-Heading-into-Monday-Night-Football-Showdown" class="headerlink" title="Broncos Favorites Heading into Monday Night Football Showdown"></a>Broncos Favorites Heading into Monday Night Football Showdown</h1><p>The Denver Broncos have made it no secret that they are one of the top teams in the NFL this season. Heading into Monday night’s showdown against the undefeated Kansas City Chiefs, the Broncos are listed as 5.5-point favorites. This is a big game for both teams, as a victory would give the Broncos control of the AFC West division and put them one step closer to securing a first-round bye in the playoffs.</p>
<p>The Broncos have been led by their impressive offense, which ranks fourth in the NFL in points scored. Quarterback Peyton Manning has been putting up some incredible numbers, throwing for 3,739 yards and 31 touchdowns so far this season. Wide receiver Demaryius Thomas has been his favorite target, hauling in 79 receptions for 1,220 yards and 10 touchdowns. The running game has also been strong, with C.J. Anderson and Ronnie Hillman each averaging over 4 yards per carry.</p>
<p>The Chiefs have had an impressive season themselves, going 9-0 so far. However, they will be facing their toughest test yet on Monday night against Denver’s high-powered offense. The Chiefs have only allowed 17 points per game this season (second best in the NFL), but they will be facing a challenge against Manning and company.</p>
<p>It should be an exciting matchup to watch on Monday night!</p>
<h1 id="Denver-Broncos-Continue-to-be-a-Popular-Betting-Pick"><a href="#Denver-Broncos-Continue-to-be-a-Popular-Betting-Pick" class="headerlink" title="Denver Broncos Continue to be a Popular Betting Pick"></a>Denver Broncos Continue to be a Popular Betting Pick</h1><p>The Denver Broncos are one of the most popular teams in the National Football League (NFL) and they continue to be a popular betting pick. The Broncos have made it to the playoffs in each of the past two seasons and they are looking to make it three in a row this year.</p>
<p>Denver is led by quarterback Case Keenum, who joined the team last year. Keenum had a breakout season with the Minnesota Vikings in 2017 and he has continued to play well for the Broncos. He has helped lead the team to a winning record in each of his first two seasons with the team.</p>
<p>The Broncos also have a strong defense, which was on display during their AFC Wild Card game against the Los Angeles Chargers last year. The Broncos were able to hold the Chargers scoreless in the second half of that game and they ended up winning 23-17.</p>
<p>Denver is certainly one of the top contenders in the AFC this year and they should be able to make it back to the playoffs. They will likely be one of the most popular betting picks again this year, so make sure you get your bets in early!</p>
<h1 id="Bettors-Continue-to-Back-the-Denver-Broncos-Heading-into-Playoffs"><a href="#Bettors-Continue-to-Back-the-Denver-Broncos-Heading-into-Playoffs" class="headerlink" title="Bettors Continue to Back the Denver Broncos Heading into Playoffs"></a>Bettors Continue to Back the Denver Broncos Heading into Playoffs</h1><p>As the NFL playoffs get set to kick off this weekend, the Denver Broncos continue to be one of the most popular teams with bettors. The Broncos opened as 2.5-point favorites at home against the Indianapolis Colts in their Wild Card matchup and remain favored by that same margin as of Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Denver is coming off a disappointing season-ending loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, but they’ve been one of the most consistent teams in the league this year and still have plenty of believers heading into the playoffs. The Broncos are 14-3-1 against the spread this season, including an impressive 8-1-1 ATS mark at home.</p>
<p>The Colts had a strong finish to the season, winning seven of their last eight games, but they’re a big underdog in this matchup against Denver. Indianapolis is just 7-9-1 ATS this year and 1-6 ATS on the road.</p>
<p>The other two matchups in the Wild Card round both have teams as underdogs that could pull off an upset. The Seattle Seahawks are 3.5-point underdogs at home against the Washington Redskins and the Houston Texans are 1.5-point dogs at home against the Baltimore Ravens.</p>
<h1 id="How-Does-Betting-on-Sports-Affect-the-Ravens-Denver-Broncos-Rivalry"><a href="#How-Does-Betting-on-Sports-Affect-the-Ravens-Denver-Broncos-Rivalry" class="headerlink" title="How Does Betting on Sports Affect the Ravens-Denver Broncos Rivalry?"></a>How Does Betting on Sports Affect the Ravens-Denver Broncos Rivalry?</h1><p>Since the Baltimore Ravens and the Denver Broncos became divisional rivals in the AFC West in 2002, the two teams have had some great games. The rivalry intensified starting in 2013 when the Broncos started dominating the Ravens, especially with Peyton Manning at quarterback. In the first six matchups between Manning and Joe Flacco, Manning led the Broncos to a perfect 6-0 record.</p>
<p>The rivalry was also affected by gambling on sports. From 2003 to 2013, $100 bet on the Ravens would earn you $176.82 on average. However, if you had bet that same amount of money on the Broncos during that time period, you would only have earned $152.35 on average. This is largely because of Peyton Manning’s success against Joe Flacco.</p>
<p>However, things started to change in 2014 when the Ravens finally got their first win against the Broncos with Flacco at quarterback. Since then, the Ravens have won 3 out of 5 matchups against Manning and the Broncos (including playoffs). This shift has caused bettors to reconsider which team is the favorite to win when these two teams play each other.</p>
<p>Now that Manning has retired and been replaced by Brock Osweiler, it is unclear how this will affect the rivalry between these two teams. However, it will definitely be interesting to see how things play out now that both teams have new quarterbacks.</p>
