<hr>
<ol>
<li>Establish Some Ground Rules</li>
</ol>

</ol>

Join a gym, take up a new hobby, or start volunteering in your community. If you have something else to focus on mentally and emotionally, you’ll be less likely to think about gambling.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Avoid Triggers</li>
</ol>

</ol>
