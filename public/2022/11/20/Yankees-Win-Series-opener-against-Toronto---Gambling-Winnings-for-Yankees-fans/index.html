<p>The Yankees improved to 5-0 against the reigning World Series champions this season, and they have now won 11 of their last 12 games overall.</p>
<p>Severino allowed just 3 hits and 1 walk while striking out 8 batters, and he has now allowed 2 runs or fewer in each of his last 10 starts.</p>
<p>The victory moved the Yankees into first place in the American League East standings, one game ahead of the Red Sox.</p>
<p>Gambling Winnings for Yankees fans<br>Yankees fans who wagered on their team prior to Thursday’s game were certainly happy with the outcome. Severino was a solid favorite at -165, and those who bet on him were rewarded with a payout of +115.</p>
<p>The Astros are now just 18-26 against teams other than the Dodgers this year, and they will look to get back on track when they host Los Angeles this weekend.</p>
<h1 id="Stanton-homers-twice-as-Yanks-down-Rays-12-1-Gambling-Winnings-for-Yankees-fans"><a href="#Stanton-homers-twice-as-Yanks-down-Rays-12-1-Gambling-Winnings-for-Yankees-fans" class="headerlink" title="Stanton homers twice as Yanks down Rays 12-1 - Gambling Winnings for Yankees fans"></a>Stanton homers twice as Yanks down Rays 12-1 - Gambling Winnings for Yankees fans</h1><p>The New York Yankees pounded the Tampa Bay Rays 12-1 Wednesday night, with Giancarlo Stanton hitting two home runs. The win was their third in a row and lifted their record to 72-41.</p>

<p>“It was nice to contribute,” Stanton said after the game. “Especially when we’re scoring runs like that.”</p>

<h1 id="Torres’-grand-slam-helps-Yankees-rout-Orioles-14-2"><a href="#Torres’-grand-slam-helps-Yankees-rout-Orioles-14-2" class="headerlink" title="Torres’ grand slam helps Yankees rout Orioles 14-2"></a>Torres’ grand slam helps Yankees rout Orioles 14-2</h1><p>Facing an Orioles team that had already beaten him three times this season, Yankees pitcher Ivan Nova looked to get back on track. Instead, he got rocked.</p>
<p>Nova allowed eight runs in 3 1/3 innings, and the Orioles pounded out 14 hits in a 14-2 victory Wednesday night.</p>
<p>“I was trying to do too much,” Nova said. “I was falling behind in the count and they were taking advantage.”</p>
<p>Baltimore got off to a quick start against Nova, tagging him for four runs in the first inning. The Orioles added two more in the second inning and another two in the fourth.</p>
<p>The big blow came in the fifth inning when Nelson Cruz crushed a grand slam off Nova to extend Baltimore’s lead to 10-0. It was Cruz’s 26th homer of the season, and his second career slam against the Yankees.</p>
<p>“It feels good,” Cruz said of his home run. “Anytime you hit a home run it feels good, but especially against these guys.”</p>
<p>The Yankees finally got on the board in the bottom of the fifth inning when Brett Gardner hit a solo homer off Orioles starter Wei-Yin Chen. New York tacked on two more runs in the sixth inning, but it was all for naught as the Orioles cruised to an easy victory.</p>
<p>“They came out swinging,” Yankees manager Joe Girardi said of the Orioles. “We didn’t really make any adjustments.”</p>
