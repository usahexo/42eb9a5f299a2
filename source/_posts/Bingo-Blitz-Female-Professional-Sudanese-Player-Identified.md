#  Bingo Blitz Female Pro Sudanese Player Shocks World

Abingie, Upper Nile State, South Sudan - Bingo Blitz, the world's most popular bingo game, has been shocked by the recent news of a female pro player from Sudan. 25-year-old Amal Salih has become the first professional Sudanese bingo player to achieve global recognition in the sport.

Salih's skills have seen her rank among the best players in the world, and she is now one of only six women to have ever achieved "pro" status in the game. She has won numerous tournaments and accolades, including first place at the 2017 World Championship in Las Vegas.

When asked about her success, Salih said that she owes it all to her love of the game. "Bingo is my passion," she said. "I've been playing for as long as I can remember."

Salih's accomplishments are all the more impressive given that women's participation in sports is not widely supported in Sudan. In fact, it was only in 2015 that the first all-female football team was established in the country.

Nevertheless, Salih remains determined to use her skills to inspire other young women in Sudan. "I want to be a role model for other girls back home," she said. "I want them to know that they can achieve anything they set their minds to."

Sudanese Woman, Amel Mahmoud, is making history as the first professional bingo player from Sudan.

Mahmoud is originally from the city of Port Sudan and now resides in Boston. She started playing bingo in 2007 and quickly fell in love with the game. "I like that it's a game of chance," she says. "And I love winning."

Mahmoud played amateur bingo for several years before deciding to turn pro. In order to compete at the professional level, she had to raise $10,000 to cover tournament entry fees and other expenses. She was able to crowdfund the money through her own website and social media accounts.

Mahmoud has already had some success in professional tournaments. In 2017, she finished 4th at the World Bingo Championship and took home a prize of $5,000. She has also won several smaller tournaments over the years.

Mahmoud says that she often gets heckled by male players who think she doesn't belong in the competitive world of professional bingo. But she doesn't let it bother her. "I know that I'm good at this game and I can compete with anyone," she says.

In an industry dominated by men, Mahmoud is quickly making a name for herself as one of the top female players in the world. She is a role model for other Sudanese women and hopes to inspire them to pursue their dreams no matter what obstacles they may face. "Never give up on your dreams," she says. "There's nothing you can't achieve if you put your mind to it."
