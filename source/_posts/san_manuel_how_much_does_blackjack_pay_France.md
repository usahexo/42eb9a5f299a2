# Understanding Blackjack Payouts at San Manuel Casino, France

Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games, and it is played in many countries around the world. If you are in France and plan to visit the San Manuel Casino, you might be wondering how much does blackjack pay. In this article, we will provide you with a complete guide to understanding blackjack payouts at San Manuel Casino, France.

## Basic Rules of Blackjack

Before diving into the payouts, it is essential to understand the basic rules of blackjack. Blackjack is a card game played with one or more decks of cards. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer by having a hand that is worth more points than the dealer's hand, without going over 21 points.

In blackjack, each card has a point value. Number cards are worth their face value, face cards (Kings, Queens, and Jacks) are worth 10 points, and Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on the player's hand.

For example, if you bet $10 and win a regular hand, you will be paid $10. But if you bet $10 and win with a blackjack, you will be paid $15.

It is important to note that some blackjack tables at San Manuel Casino may have different payout ratios. For example, some tables may offer a 6:5 payout for a blackjack, which means that if you bet $10 and get a natural blackjack, you will be paid $12 instead of the standard $15.
