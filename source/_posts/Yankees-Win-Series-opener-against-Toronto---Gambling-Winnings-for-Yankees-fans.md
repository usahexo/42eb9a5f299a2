The Yankees finally got on the board in the bottom of the fifth inning when Brett Gardner hit a solo homer off Orioles starter Wei-Yin Chen. New York tacked on two more runs in the sixth inning, but it was all for naught as the Orioles cruised to an easy victory.

"They came out swinging," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said of the Orioles. "We didn't really make any adjustments."
