#  State Can Regulate Casino, But What About Roulette?

In a unanimous decision, the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of New Jersey, overturning a 26-year-old federal ban on sports betting. The high court ruled that the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) was unconstitutional because it violated states’ rights to regulate gambling within their borders.

A number of states are now moving quickly to legalize sports betting, including New Jersey, Mississippi, West Virginia, and Rhode Island. The American Gaming Association estimates that $150 billion is gambled on sports each year in the U.S., most of it illegally.

But the legalization of sports betting raises another question: Can states also legalize casino gambling? The answer is yes.

In 2011, the state of Illinois legalized video poker and other casino games at its racetracks. In 2013, Colorado voters approved a measure to allow limited casino gambling in three locations: Black Hawk, Central City, and Cripple Creek. And in 2016, Pennsylvania became the fourth state to legalize online casino gambling.

So why did the Supreme Court rule that PASPA was unconstitutional, but say nothing about state regulation of casino gambling? The answer has to do with the history of gaming laws in the U.S.

The first gaming law in the U.S. was enacted in 1792 in Connecticut. It prohibited all forms of gambling except for lotteries authorized by the state legislature. Other states followed with similar laws.

In 1819, Congress passed the Act to Protect Against Gambling Devices, which made it a federal crime to own or operate any device used for gambling purposes within the United States. In 1831, Congress passed the Interstate Commerce Act, which prohibited transportation of gaming devices between states. And in 1856, Congress passed the second Morrill Act (the first Morrill Act provided land grants for colleges), which banned all lotteries in the U.S., including state-sponsored lotteries.

It was against this backdrop that PASPA was enacted in 1992 as part of an effort by Congress to prohibit state-sponsored sports betting nationwide. PASPA gave states two options: either prohibit all forms of sports betting or allow it only within certain “grandfathered” jurisdictions (Delaware, Nevada, Oregon, and Montana). New Jersey was one of four states that chose not to participate in PASPA’s “grandfathered” program and has been fighting ever since to overturn the federal ban.

In its opinion today overturning PASPA, the Supreme Court held that Congress exceeded its authority by regulating state legislatures’ abilities to enact their own gaming laws:
It is as much an exercise of congressional power to protect state autonomy from intrusive federal laws that intrude on state sovereignty as it is to protect individual liberty from undue government interference... When considered together with [the Constitution's] Commerce Clause emphasis on free trade among States... these structural features compel us to recognize that Art III [the anti-commandeering principle] protects more than just those individual liberties enumerated in Amendments I and II...It safeguards institutional integrity as well by shielding individual States from coercion by threatening their ability to carry out desired policy choices evidenced by broad popular majorities .

In other words, while Congress may have authority under the Commerce Clause to prohibit interstate transportation of gambling devices (which it did through enactment of the Interstate Commerce Act), it does not have authority under the Constitution to tell states what kinds of gambling they can or cannot allow within their borders .
This distinction is important because it means that states can now legalize casino gambling even if it is not specifically allowed under PASPA .

#  State Can Regulate Casino, But Does It Have The Authority To Touch Blackjack?

The issue of state regulation of casinos is a murky one. The legality of gambling is a matter of federal law, so the states are limited in what they can do. However, some forms of gambling are specifically carved out as being under state jurisdiction. This appears to include blackjack, which has been the focus of recent litigation in New York.

In October of last year, a New York appeals court ruled that the state could not regulate blackjack at tribal casinos. The court found that blackjack is a game that is specifically reserved for the tribes under the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. This overturned a lower court ruling from 2016 that allowed the state to regulate the game.

This case is not just about blackjack, but also about tribal sovereignty. The tribes argue that they have authority to regulate their own gaming activities, free from interference from the states. The states argue that they have an important role in overseeing and regulating gambling activity in order to protect consumers and ensure fair and honest play.

This case has potentially far-reaching implications for casino regulation in the United States. If the tribes are successful in establishing that they have exclusive authority to regulate blackjack, it could open the door for them to expand their gaming operations beyond what is currently allowed under federal law. This could lead to increased competition with state-run casinos, which could result in less revenue for those casinos and fewer jobs in the industry.

#  State Can Regulate Casino, Though Poker Players May Disagree

The state has the power to regulate casinos, though poker players may disagree.

States have long had the right to regulate casinos within their boundaries. This right was affirmed in a recent federal appeals court ruling. The decision allows states to prohibit casinos, or to impose regulations on them, as they see fit.

This ruling is good news for casino owners and employees, who can now be assured that their businesses will be subject to regulation by the states in which they operate. It is also good news for state governments, which can now generate revenue from casino operations.

Poker players may not be so happy with the ruling, however. Many of them believe that poker is a game of skill, and should not be regulated as if it were a game of chance. They argue that poker should be allowed to be played in unregulated settings, such as private homes or online, where there is no risk of collusion or cheating.

It is unlikely that the federal government will get involved in this debate any time soon. For now, it appears that poker players will have to live with state regulation of the game.

#  Can State Really Regulate Casino If It Bans Slot Machines?

Casino operators in the US have long been pushing for state-by-state regulation of their industry, rather than the current federal system. But a recent study on the effects of legalizing and regulating casino gambling in Rhode Island casts doubt on whether state regulation can really work, at least when it comes to slot machines.

The study, conducted by researchers at Brown University, found that while casinos did bring in new revenue to the state, this was more than offset by increased costs associated with problem gambling. In other words, while state regulation may be good for casinos, it’s not so good for taxpayers.

This shouldn’t come as a surprise, given that slot machines are one of the most addictive forms of casino gambling. They’re also responsible for most of the revenue generated by casinos, so it’s no wonder casinos are fighting so hard to keep them legal.

But if states want to protect their taxpayers – and their citizens – from the social costs of problem gambling, they need to take a hard look at whether regulating casino gambling is really worth it.

#  State Can Regulate Casino - Fining Operators Who Don't Comply

The state has the power to regulate casino gambling within its borders, including the power to fine operators who don't comply with regulations, the state Supreme Court ruled Thursday.

The unanimous decision affirmed a lower court ruling that dismissed a challenge by two casinos, a trade group and an individual to a 2017 state law that authorized fines of up to $100,000 per day against those who violate state casino laws.

Justice David DeBruler wrote that the law "gives the Gaming Commission broad authority to enforce casino laws and protect the public."

The law "allows for administrative fines to be levied in addition to other available remedies, such as criminal prosecutions and revocation of licenses," he wrote.

Casino owner Penn National Gaming and Racetrack owner MI Developments argued that the state law intruded on their constitutional rights to due process and equal protection. But DeBruler said the law is a "reasonable exercise" of the state's police power.

Penn National spokesman Eric Schippers said the company was "disappointed" in the ruling and was considering its next steps. MI Developments didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
