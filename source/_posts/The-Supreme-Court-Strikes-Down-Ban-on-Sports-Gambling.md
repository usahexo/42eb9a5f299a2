#  The Supreme Court Strikes Down Ban on Sports Gambling

The United States Supreme Court has ruled in favor of legalizing sports gambling, striking down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) as unconstitutional. The decision opens the door for states to legalize and regulate sports betting within their borders.

The ruling is a major victory for the gaming industry, which has pushed for years for the repeal of PASPA. Major casino companies like MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment have already announced plans to expand their gambling operations in anticipation of the ruling.

The Court’s opinion was written by Justice Samuel Alito, who was joined by the Court’s liberal wing in the majority. Alito noted that PASPA violated the Tenth Amendment by forcing states to prohibit sports gambling. He also rejected the arguments of the Solicitor General, who had defended PASPA, that sports betting posed a threat to the integrity of sporting competitions.

The decision is a major blow to the NFL, NBA, MLB, and other professional sports leagues, which have opposed legalized sports gambling. The leagues have argued that widespread legal sports betting would damage the integrity of their games and lead to more game-fixing scandals.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg issued a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Stephen Breyer. Ginsburg argued that PASPA did not violate the Tenth Amendment and that it was necessary to protect the integrity of professional sports.

#  The House of Representatives Passes Bill to Legalize Sports Gambling

On Wednesday, the House of Representatives passed a bill that would legalize sports gambling across the United States. The bill, known as the “Sports Gaming Innovation and Integrity Act”, was sponsored by Republican representative Frank Pallone of New Jersey.

If passed by the Senate and signed into law by President Trump, the bill would overturn the 1992 federal ban on sports gambling. States would then be free to legalize and regulate sports betting within their borders.

Supporters of the bill argue that it will generate billions of dollars in revenue for states, create thousands of jobs, and protect the integrity of games. Opponents argue that it will lead to increased addiction and crime rates.

The Supreme Court is expected to rule on a similar case later this year, with a decision that could overturn the federal ban on sports betting.

#  New Jersey Governor Signs Legislation to Legalize Sports Gambling

On Monday, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy signed into law legislation that will allow for the legalized sports gambling in the state. This makes New Jersey the second state in the nation, after Delaware, to offer legal sports betting.

The new law allows licensed casinos and racetracks in the state to offer sports betting, with mobile betting options also available. Bettors will be able to place wagers on professional and collegiate sporting events, both in-person and online.

Governor Murphy praised the new law, stating that it will bring much-needed revenue to the state while also creating jobs. He said that the law would "make New Jersey more competitive" and put "Atlantic City back on the map."

Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it will lead to increased gambling addiction and other social problems. However, supporters maintain that it is a viable way to generate tax revenue and create jobs.

It is estimated that the new law could bring in as much as $200 million in annual revenue for New Jersey.

#  Delaware Becomes the First State to Allow Online Sports Gambling

Delaware has become the first state to allow full-fledged online sports gambling. Governor John Carney signed the bill into law on May 14, 2018, authorizing the Delaware Lottery to offer betting on professional and college sports games over the internet. The new law takes effect on June 5, 2018.

"This legislation will make Delaware the national leader in legalized sports betting and create new jobs in our casinos and restaurants," said Governor Carney.

Under the new law, players must be physically present in Delaware to place a bet at a casino or racetrack. However, they will be able to place bets online through the Delaware Lottery website. The Lottery plans to hire 50 people to work in its sports betting operation.

The NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, and NCAA all oppose legalized sports gambling, but have not taken any legal action to stop it. "We will review the details of this new law and continue to monitor developments in other states," said Gregg Doyel, an NBA spokesman.

Supporters of legalized sports gambling say that it will generate much-needed tax revenue for state governments. They also argue that it will help boost tourism and create jobs. Opponents contend that it will lead to increased rates of addiction and crime.

#  Nevada Amends Laws to Allow Sports Gambling at Casinos

Nevada has altered its regulations to allow sports gambling at casinos effective as of September 1. This alteration in the law overturns a prior ruling from December 2015, which disallowed sports gambling in the state. The change will now require casinos to apply for licenses in order to offer legal sports betting to their customers.

The amendment was passed through both state legislative chambers and signed into law by Governor Brian Sandoval on June 14. The bill reflects a keen interest on the part of casino owners to capitalize on the current popularity of sports betting, especially with the launch of new professional franchises in Las Vegas and Oakland. In addition to Nevada, Delaware, Montana, and Oregon currently allow some form of legalized sports gambling.

Proponents of the amendment argue that it will generate new tax revenue for the state and provide a more regulated environment for gambling, while opponents worry that it could lead to increased addiction problems. Under the new law, casinos will be able to offer bets on sporting events both in person and online. The minimum age for placing a bet is 21 years old.

With Nevada's repeal of its ban on sports gambling, other states may follow suit as they weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of this form of wagering. Casinos stand to benefit handsomely from expanded sports betting opportunities, but poor implementation or regulation could lead to negative consequences for consumers and the public at large.
