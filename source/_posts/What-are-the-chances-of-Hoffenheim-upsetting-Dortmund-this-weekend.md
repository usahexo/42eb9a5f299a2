#  What are the chances of Hoffenheim upsetting Dortmund this weekend?

In the Bundesliga this weekend, Hoffenheim will be taking on Borussia Dortmund. The two teams are in very different form at the moment, with Hoffenheim only winning one of their last five games, while Dortmund have won four out of their last five.

This is reflected in the odds for the match as well. While Hoffenheim are seen as reasonable outsiders to win at around 5/1, Dortmund are seen as heavy favourites and are priced at just 1/4 to win.

It’s not really surprising that Dortmund are so big favourites for this game. They are currently third in the table, while Hoffenheim are down in 11th place. Hoffenheim have also been quite inconsistent this season, while Dortmund have looked much more solid.

Dortmund should be able to take advantage of this and pick up an easy win on Saturday.

#  How does the Asian handicap betting work for Hoffenheim vs. Dortmund?

The Bundesliga returns this weekend and we take a look at one of the most interesting games, Hoffenheim vs. Dortmund. Hoffenheim are in 9th place with 11 points from 8 games, while Dortmund are in 2nd place with 20 points from 8 games.

Dortmund are clear favourites for the game, but Hoffenheim will be playing at home and will be looking to cause an upset. One way that Hoffenheim could try and do this is by using the Asian handicap betting market.

The Asian handicap betting market gives each team a handicap, which is essentially a goals deduction. So for example, if Hoffenheim were given a +1.5 handicap, this would mean that they start the game with 1.5 goals deducted from their final score. This makes them more competitive against teams like Dortmund who have a stronger attacking line-up.

In the Hoffenheim vs. Dortmund game, the odds for the +1.5 handicap are 2/1 (3.00) with Bet365*. This means that if you back Hoffenheim to win with a +1.5 handicap, then you will receive 3 times your stake if they win the game. So if you back them at £10 then you will receive £30 back if they win!

#  What is the best strategy for betting on Hoffenheim in their upcoming clash with Dortmund?

Now that we are just days away from the Hoffenheim vs Dortmund match, many bettors will be trying to come up with the best betting strategy for this game. Hoffenheim have had a great season so far and sit in 4th place in the Bundesliga table, while Dortmund are in second place. This is sure to be a very close match, but here are three tips that could help you make some profits on the game.

1. Back Hoffenheim to win

This may seem like an obvious choice, but Hoffenheim have been in great form this season and are definitely capable of beating Dortmund. They have only lost two games all season and both of those were away from home. At home, they have won six games and drawn two, so they are definitely strong at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena.

Dortmund have also been performing well this season, but they have been known to struggle against teams who sit back and defend deep. Hoffenheim are likely to do this and could cause Dortmund some problems. For these reasons, backing Hoffenheim to win at odds of 2/1 or better could be a good bet.

2. Bet on Both Teams to Score

Another option worth considering is betting on Both Teams to Score. This has paid out in four of Hoffenheim’s last six home games and six of Dortmund’s last seven matches. With both teams being in good form, there is a good chance that we could see some goals in this game. Odds of around 5/6 could be good value for this bet.

3. Bet on Over 2.5 goals

The final option worth considering is betting on Over 2.5 goals scored in the game. This has happened in five of Hoffenheim’s last six home matches and four of Dortmund’s last seven games overall. As both teams tend to score a lot of goals, Over 2.5 goals is usually a safe option to go for when betting on this fixture. Odds of 1/1 or better could be worth taking a chance on.
